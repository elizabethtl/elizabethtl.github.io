  desc: "I conduct research in software supply chain security under
   advisor William Enck, combining technical security analysis with 
   qualitative research methods. I build data-driven applications 
   using Python and JavaScript with MongoDB and asynchronous worker 
   queues to process large datasets. My technical work involves 
   static analysis with CodeQL, vulnerability assessments, and 
   threat modeling across software ecosystems and IDE extensions. 
   I also conduct qualitative studies, including interviews with 
   industry professionals, to understand real-world security practices. 
   My research has been published at NDSS and USENIX Security."

  desc: "I was selected as a summer research fellow at Chainguard Labs, where 
    I led an independent research project investigating how various static 
    analysis tools perform reachability analysis across different programming 
    languages (Go, Python, C). My research revealed significant discrepancies 
    in how different tools assess vulnerability reachability, highlighting 
    critical gaps in current software supply chain security tooling. 
    I also contributed to a comparative analysis of glibc and musl in 
    containerized environments. This fellowship provided valuable industry research 
    experience and deepened my understanding of practical challenges in vulnerability 
    assessment at scale."
