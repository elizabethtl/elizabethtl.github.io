# Hi

I'm Elizabeth, a computer science PhD student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/).  
I'm currently doing security research at the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/) at NC State, which I'll be wrapping up soon! 

**I'm graduating Spring 2026 and actively seeking full-time opportunities in security research or software security engineering**, 
feel free to contact me if you think I'd be a fit!

I focus on **software supply chain security**, working on both technical studies
 (static analysis with CodeQL, threat modeling) and qualitative research 
 (interviews, user studies) to understand and solve real-world security problems:

- 🏆 Distinguished Paper Award at NDSS 2024 for work on VS Code extension 
  security affecting 6M+ users
- 📊 Conducted user studies with 20+ industry professionals on vulnerability 
  management practices (USENIX Security 2025)
- 🎤 Presented at NDSS, USENIX Security, VulnCon, and InfoSeCon

 (More about my research [here](/research))

**Technical skills:** Python, JavaScript, MongoDB, CodeQL, static analysis, 
qualitative research methods, large-scale data processing

I've also had experience with full stack web development with JavaScript, 
and I enjoy teaching and mentoring - from teaching coding to elementary students 
to presenting research at academic and industry conferences.
