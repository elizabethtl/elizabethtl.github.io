# Hi

I'm Elizabeth, a computer science PhD student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/).

I'm currently doing security research at the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/) at NC State, which I'll be wrapping up soon! 

**I'm open to full-time opportunities in the next 6~12 months**, feel free to contact me if you think I'd be a fit!

Research-wise, anything that's a problem interests me. (more about my research [here](/research))

Right now, I'm focusing on securing the software supply chain and triaging vulnerabilities.
But I've also had experience with full stack web development with JavaScript.
