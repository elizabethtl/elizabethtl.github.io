# Hi

I'm Elizabeth, a computer science PhD student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/).

I'm currently doing security research at the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/) at NC State.

Research-wise, anything that's a problem interests me. 
Right now, I'm focusing on securing the software supply chain and triaging vulnerabilities.
