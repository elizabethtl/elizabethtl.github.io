# More about me

I love playing sports, I am most passionate about soccer and have been playing it since I was six.
Recently, I've also been really into tennis.

I also enjoy reading.

Thriller and mystery and historical fiction are some of my favorite genres.
My new favorites are *The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo* and *The Silent Patient*.

I read various non-fiction books related to international affairs, business, or biographies.
The most recent one I read (and I highly recommend) is *Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty*.
