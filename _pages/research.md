## UntrustIDE: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in VS Code Extensions

VS Code is the most popular IDE for developers. In this study we take a look at its extension ecosystem, the marketplace.

As the first ecosystem-wide research, we proposed a threat model and identified vulnerabilities within the ecosystem with taint analysis using [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/).

Our CodeQL queries for taint analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/s3c2/UntrustIDE).

In total, we identified and verified vulnerabilities and their proof-of-concept exploits for 21 extensions, impacting 6 million users.
