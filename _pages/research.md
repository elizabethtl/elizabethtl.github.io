# Research

## SCA Usability

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is often discussed in software supply chain security. 
However, there lacks an understanding of how SCA tools are used and how they can be improved for better vulnerability management.

More details [here](https://s3c2.org/studies/sca-usability)

From talking to 20 industry professionals, we've discovered a lack of context along the entire SCA deployment process.

## UntrustIDE

**Distinguished Paper Award** @ NDSS Symposium 2024

VS Code is the most popular IDE for developers. In this study we take a look at its extension ecosystem, the marketplace.
As the first ecosystem-wide research, we proposed a threat model and identified vulnerabilities within the ecosystem with taint analysis using [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/).
In total, we identified and verified vulnerabilities and their proof-of-concept exploits for 21 extensions, impacting 6 million users.

Don't want to read the full paper? My short [blog post](/untrustide) includes an overview of our methods, findings, and an example of how a vulnerable data flow in an extension could lead to code execution.

## Software Bill of Materials (SBoMs)

A grey literature review was conducted on articles relating to the benefits and challenges of SBoMs.

The top 5 benefits and challenges are outlined in the following article.

Are We There Yet?](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10102604?casa_token=NVD2tRbNNHUAAAAA:vbRR4xuGYuPFZgiUntR7TiZZDW-yY6juXO3XAYDyFKAPEBQ037xjRgYy6BfhP7DUrx5zgQP27g) IEEE Security & Privacy 21, no. 2 (2023): 82-88.


## VFCFinder

A tool that generated the top 5 vulnerable fixing commits for a given security advisory.

VFCFinder used to backfill over 300 missing VFCs in the GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) database.
