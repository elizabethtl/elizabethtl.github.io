## UntrustIDE: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in VS Code Extensions

VS Code is the most popular IDE for developers. In this study we take a look at its extension ecosystem, the marketplace.

As the first ecosystem-wide research, we proposed a threat model and identified vulnerabilities within the ecosystem with taint analysis using [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/).

Identified vulnerabilities were sampled and proof-of-concept exploits were generated to verify them.
