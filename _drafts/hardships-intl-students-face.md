title:  The hardships international students face in the US

I should say this first, I am *not* an international student, 
so I personally did not have to face the challenges.

But **so so so many** of my friends did.

### Visa Issues

Being an alien in a country, or a non-citizen, the most pressing issue is: 
am I allowed to lawfully stay in this country?
It doesn't occur to you when you travel abroad, since vacations don't usually last more than a couple weeks.

But then when you want to stay in a country for longer period of time, are you allowed to?

Many international students come to the US on student visas, as long as they are a student, they are allowed to stay.
Then after they graduate, they're no longer students, which means the visa status changes.
So, how do they stay?
They find a job and get a working visa.
All is good, *if* you have a job.
If, unfortunately you lose your job, you lose your working status.
You got like 3 months to find a new one or you don't have legal status in the country.

With certain visas, there also come certain restrictions.

For example, if you're on a student visa, you're not allowed to get a full-time job or work over a certain number of hours.
So international students don't really have the luxury to just drop-out of school and get a job.

Visa issues extend to so many other challenges for non-citizens.

##### Work-related challenges

It also affects international students when they're finding a job. They would need to convince an employer to hire them instead of a US citizen and sponsor them for a working visa.
